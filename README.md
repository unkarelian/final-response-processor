# Final Response Processor

A SillyTavern extension that allows you to manually refine AI messages through configurable processing steps. Simply click the magic wand button on any AI message to apply your refinement steps.

## Features

- **Manual Refinement**: Click the refinement button on any AI message to process it
- **Search & Replace Tags**: Uses `<search>` and `<replace>` tags for precise edits
- **Multiple Steps**: Configure multiple refinement steps with different prompts
- **Connection Profile Support**: Use different AI models for each refinement step
- **Non-Invasive**: Doesn't interfere with normal chat generation

## How It Works

1. Click the magic wand button (ðŸª„) that appears on AI messages
2. The extension processes the message through your configured refinement steps
3. Each step can use search/replace tags to make specific edits
4. The message is updated in-place with the refined content

## Installation

1. Copy the `final-response-processor` folder to your SillyTavern extensions directory:
   - Local extensions: `data/default-user/extensions/`
   
2. Restart SillyTavern or reload the page

3. The extension is automatically enabled and ready to use

## Configuration

### Refinement Steps
Each step can have:
- **Step Name**: Descriptive name for the step
- **Connection Profile**: Select which AI model/API to use for this step
- **System Prompt**: System instructions for the refinement
- **User Message**: The prompt sent to refine the response
- **Skip if No Changes**: Skip subsequent steps if no edits are made

### Using Search & Replace Tags

The AI should respond with edits in this format:
```
<search>text to find in the original</search>
<replace>text to replace it with</replace>
```

Multiple edits can be specified:
```
<search>old text 1</search>
<replace>new text 1</replace>

<search>old text 2</search>
<replace>new text 2</replace>
```

### Available Macros

- `{{draft}}` - The current message content being refined
- `{{savedMessages}}` - The last N chat messages prior to the refined message (configurable in settings)
- `{{char}}` - Character name
- `{{user}}` - User name
- All other standard SillyTavern macros

### Saved Messages Macro

Enable **Saved Messages Macro** in the extension settings to expose additional chat context to your prompts:

- Toggle the option to show the "Last messages to include" input.
- Set a positive number to include that many previous messages (the current assistant message is excluded automatically).
- Use `-1` to include the entire chat history prior to the refined message.
- Set `0` or leave the feature disabled to omit additional context.

## Example Configuration

**Step 1: Grammar and Style**
- Connection Profile: "GPT-4 Editor" (or any profile configured for editing tasks)
- System Prompt: "You are a helpful editor that improves grammar and style."
- User Message: "Please improve the grammar and style of the following text using search/replace tags:\n\n{{draft}}"

**Step 2: Tone Adjustment**
- Connection Profile: "Claude Creative" (or use "Current Profile" to use the same as chat)
- System Prompt: "You adjust the tone of text to be more engaging."
- User Message: "Make the following text more engaging:\n\n{{draft}}\n\nUse <search> and <replace> tags."

**Step 3: Remove Repetitive Phrases (with ProsePolisher)**
- Connection Profile: "Current Profile"
- System Prompt: "You are an editor that removes repetitive phrases while maintaining the message's meaning."
- User Message: "The following repetitive phrases were detected in the chat: {{slopList}}\n\nPlease edit this text to avoid or reduce these repetitive patterns:\n\n{{draft}}\n\nUse <search> and <replace> tags to make specific edits."

## Connection Profiles

The extension integrates with SillyTavern's Connection Manager to allow different AI models for each refinement step:

- **Current Profile**: Uses the same connection as your current chat
- **Custom Profiles**: Select from any Connection Manager profiles you've configured
- **Model & Sampler Selection**: Connection profiles apply the model and generation settings (temperature, top_p, etc.) from the selected profile
- **Reverse Proxy Support**: Works with reverse proxy configurations in your connection profiles
- **Prompt Structure**: The system prompt and user message defined in each step are used, NOT the prompt template from the connection profile
- **Fallback**: If a profile fails, the extension falls back to the current chat connection

### Important Notes:
- Connection profiles only change the model and generation parameters
- The prompt structure (system/user messages) is always controlled by the step configuration
- Reverse proxy settings are automatically applied from the selected profile
- Requires the Connection Manager extension to be enabled

### Use Cases:
- Use a fast model (e.g., GPT-3.5) for grammar checking
- Use a creative model (e.g., Claude) for tone adjustment
- Use specialized models for specific refinement tasks
- Test refinements across different models without changing your main chat

## Usage Tips

1. **Processing Indicator**: The magic wand icon turns into a spinner while processing
2. **Success/Error Messages**: Toast notifications show the status of refinement operations
3. **Multiple Refinements**: You can refine the same message multiple times
4. **Any AI Message**: Works on any AI message in the chat, including older messages

## Troubleshooting

**Button not appearing on messages:**
- Make sure the extension is loaded (check browser console)
- The button only appears on AI messages, not user or system messages
- Try refreshing the page

**Refinement failing:**
- Check that at least one refinement step is configured
- Ensure the AI is responding with proper `<search>` and `<replace>` tags
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify Connection Manager is enabled if using custom profiles

**No changes being applied:**
- Ensure the search text exactly matches content in the message
- Check that the refinement prompt clearly instructs the AI to use the tags
- Try enabling "Skip if no changes" to see if the AI is finding anything to change

## Recent Updates

### ProsePolisher Integration (2025-01-23)

Added integration with the ProsePolisher extension to automatically analyze chat history for repetitive phrases before applying refinements:

- **Automatic Analysis**: When you click the refinement button, the extension now triggers ProsePolisher to analyze the entire chat history first
- **Slop Detection**: ProsePolisher identifies repetitive phrases and patterns, making them available via the `{{slopList}}` macro
- **Smart Refinements**: Your refinement prompts can now reference `{{slopList}}` to avoid or fix detected repetitive phrases

### Technical Integration:
- Added `triggerProsePolisherAnalysis()` function that calls ProsePolisher's silent analysis
- Updated loading order to ensure ProsePolisher loads first (loading_order: 1001)
- Added ProsePolisher as an optional dependency in manifest.json
- ProsePolisher exports its analysis function via `window.ProsePolisher.performSilentAnalysis`
- The integration works gracefully - if ProsePolisher is not installed, refinement continues normally

### Bug Fixes (2025-01-23)

Fixed two critical issues that were affecting the extension's functionality:

1. **Formatting Issue Fixed**: Messages now properly retain their formatting (markdown, code blocks, etc.) after refinement. Previously, refined messages would lose formatting until the page was refreshed. This was fixed by using SillyTavern's `updateMessageBlock` function instead of directly setting HTML content.

2. **Consistency Improvements**: 
   - Added event listeners for `MESSAGE_UPDATED` and `MESSAGE_SWIPED` events to ensure refinement buttons persist when messages are modified
   - Implemented MutationObserver to automatically re-add the refinement button if it gets removed during DOM updates
   - Added proper button re-insertion after message refinement to maintain UI consistency

### Technical Changes:
- Added imports for `messageFormatting` and `updateMessageBlock` from script.js
- Fixed `updateMessageBlock` call to include the message object parameter
- Enhanced event handling for better button persistence across UI updates
- Improved DOM mutation handling to maintain extension functionality
